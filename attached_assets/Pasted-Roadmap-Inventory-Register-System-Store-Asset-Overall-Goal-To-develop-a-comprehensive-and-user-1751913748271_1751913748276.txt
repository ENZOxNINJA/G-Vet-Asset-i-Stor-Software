Roadmap: Inventory Register System (Store & Asset)
Overall Goal: To develop a comprehensive and user-friendly inventory management system that tracks store items and assets, facilitates multi-unit operations, and provides location-based tracking.
Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering (Weeks 1-3)
Objective: Define the scope, detailed requirements, and foundational architecture.
Key Activities:
 * Stakeholder Interviews & Needs Assessment:
   * Identify all users (store managers, asset managers, IT, finance).
   * Gather requirements for item types (consumables, fixed assets), quantities, locations, in/out processes, reporting, and user roles.
   * Specific focus: Multi-unit needs (what constitutes a unit, how do they interact with inventory).
 * Current State Analysis:
   * Document existing inventory processes (manual logs, spreadsheets, existing software).
   * Identify pain points and inefficiencies.
 * Define Core Data Model:
   * Items: Item ID, Name, Description, Category, Unit of Measure, Current Quantity, Reorder Level, Supplier Info.
   * Assets: Asset ID, Name, Description, Category, Serial Number, Purchase Date, Cost, Depreciation Method, Current Location (FK to Location Table), Assigned To (FK to User Table), Status (In Use, In Storage, Under Repair, Disposed).
   * Locations: Location ID, Name, Address, Type (Store, Warehouse, Specific Room/Unit).
   * Transactions: Transaction ID, Item/Asset ID, Type (In, Out, Transfer, Adjustment), Quantity, Date/Time, User, Source/Destination Location.
   * Units: Unit ID, Unit Name, Address, Contact Person (if multi-unit tracking involves separate entities/locations).
 * Technology Stack Selection:
   * Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL (for relational data, good for complex queries and integrity).
   * Backend: Python (Django/Flask), Node.js (Express), Ruby on Rails (for rapid development and robust frameworks).
